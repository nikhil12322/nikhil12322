# Hi! My Name is Nikhil

I'm a 10 year old Indian boy who loves coding. I live in the United States of America.

I'm learning Python, which is also my primary language, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, maybe C and Java in the future.

**Pronouns**: he/him/his

## My Broken Repository

I'm currently working on `plot-coprime`, a repository with broken commit histor. You can't see it since it's private, but I will make it public soon. I call it "broken history" because first of all, the commits do not have the right authors, second of all, the dates of most of the commits are incorrect, and third of all, some of the commits were copied into the serverside, and I pulled it into the local repository. I hope to fix it soon, so I can make it public again.

However, I know `plot-coprime` will never be the same again. Why? Because the dates on some commits will be wrong and I have no way of recovering them.

### Groups

Currently, I have no GitLab groups. I will make one and replace this with a list with one iten: the name of my first GitLab group. It will be a hyperlink to the group.
